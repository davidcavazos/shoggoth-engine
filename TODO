+ Save input commands as a replay script
+ Implement OpenGL Core and shaders
+ Advanced lighting (spotlights and directional lights)
+ Debug camera
+ Viewport & Occlusion Culling (BulletPhysics DbvtCullingDemo)
~ Add more primitives (sphere, cilinder, cone, torus, etc)
~ Use relative positions to the camera for physics and rendering
~ Debug Bullet physics renderer
~ Add constraints support
~ Add soft body support
- Make input manager into a vector, only one can be active at a time (XML)
- Binding keys (or other inputs) with a command
- Possibility of multiple active cameras in different viewports
- Change Camera viewport data to double (percentage values instead of absolute pixels)
- Update XML scene reader for viewport default value
- Animations

BUGS:
Concave hulls in RigidBody crash!

NOTES:
All components must remove at destructor ONLY the commands and attributes created by it, all other objects can safely remove all
