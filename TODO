+ Implement OpenGL Core and shaders
+ Save input commands as a replay script
+ Networking
+ GUI and 2D stuff
~ Add more primitives for RenderableMesh (sphere, cilinder, cone, etc)
~ Fog
~ Transparency
~ Multisampling
~ Use relative positions to the camera for physics and rendering
~ Add static plane, heightmap, etc in physics
~ Add constraints support
~ Add soft body support
- Make input manager into a vector, only one can be active at a time (XML)
- Binding keys (or other inputs) with a command
- Possibility of multiple active cameras in different viewports
- Debug camera
- Debug Bullet physics renderer
- Change Camera viewport data to double (percentage values instead of absolute pixels)
- Update XML scene reader for viewport default value
- Animations
- Occlusion Culling (BulletPhysics DbvtCullingDemo)
- Make scripting support all regular expresions of any scripting language

BUGS:
Concave hulls in RigidBody crash!
Fix orientation of spotlights and maybe directional lights
Fix texture compression
