+ set default gravity to -9.81
+ Add Transform class and change in renderer to use the transform
+ Change ptree::path_type() to xmlPath()

+ Frustum & Occlusion Culling (BulletPhysics DbvtCullingDemo)

~ Use relative positions to the camera for physics and rendering
~ Add static plane, heightmap, etc in physics
~ Add constraints support
~ Add soft body support
- Make input manager into a vector, only one can be active at a time (XML)
- Binding keys (or other inputs) with a command
- Possibility of multiple active cameras in different viewports
- Debug camera
- Debug Bullet physics renderer
- Change Camera viewport data to double (percentage values instead of absolute pixels)
- Update XML scene reader for viewport default value
- Animations
